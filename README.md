## What it is
A simple Vigenere cipher encoder/decoder.

## What is a Vigenere cipher?
Falsely described as "le chiffrage ind√©chiffrable" (the indecipherable cipher), a Vigenere cipher is a cipher method in which a key is used to encode/decode the message.
To read more, visit [this Wikipedia page] (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vigen%C3%A8re_cipher).

## Using
If encoding, enter the message you wish to encode and the key you wish to use in their respective sections. If decoding, enter the encoded message and the same key.
Keep in mind:
* The key's character length should be greater than or equal to that of the message.
* The key should not contain any special characters.
* The message may contain special characters, but they will be omitted in the final message.

## Installing + Running
If you want to install and run this project on your own device,
1. Install the repo
2. If using VSCode, install the LiveServer extension. I am not sure how to run this on other IDEs.
